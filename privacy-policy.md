# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** August 13, 2025

This privacy policy outlines how our n8n automation system, which connects WhatsApp AI Assistants to Google Sheets, accesses and handles your data when you authorize our app through Google APIs.

## 1. What We Access

Our application requests access only to the Google Sheets you explicitly authorize via OAuth. We use the following Google API scope:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`

This scope allows the app to read from and write to your spreadsheets.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use the Google Sheets API for the sole purpose of automating data entry and retrieval between your WhatsApp AI Assistant and your spreadsheets. Specifically:

- Storing user interactions and data from WhatsApp into a Google Sheet.
- Reading data from the Google Sheet to enable context-aware conversations in WhatsApp.

All data interactions are initiated and controlled by your workflows in **n8n**.

## 3. What We Don’t Do

- We **do not** access any other part of your Google account.
- We **do not** share your data with third parties.
- We **do not** store or persist your spreadsheet data outside of your Google Sheets.
- We **do not** retain OAuth tokens or user data after authorization is revoked.

## 4. Data Security

- All API communication is encrypted via HTTPS.
- Only authorized workflows and users can access your spreadsheet data.

## 5. Revoking Access

You can revoke the app’s access to your Google Sheets at any time by visiting:
